"""Generate the P&L sample set that Issue #10 consumes (producer for #9 -> #10).

Issue #10 (Exchange Rebate Pivotality Analysis) needs the P&L engine's output
across many model configurations, not a single run. ``RebatePivotalityAnalyzer``
ingests ``List[pd.Series]`` of ``generate_pnl()`` output and averages the
Bernoulli seeds. This script produces exactly that, on disk, so #10 can be
developed and re-run without touching Databento.

Why a sweep rather than one run
-------------------------------
``PnLCalculator`` fills passively with probability ``p`` per trade, so a single
replay is one random sample of the P&L, not the expectation. Averaging over
``N_SEEDS`` estimates the expectation. Sweeping ``p`` and ``max_position`` on
top of that gives #10 the surface it needs: the required rebate depends on how
often you are at the head of the queue and on how much inventory you tolerate
before legging out.

Break-even rebate
-----------------
Net P&L is linear in the passive fee, since that fee is charged per passively
filled contract and nothing else in the model depends on it:

    net(f) = cash + position_mark - f * filled - hedge_costs

Setting net = 0 and solving gives the passive fee at which the strategy breaks
even:

    breakeven_passive_fee = (cash + position_mark - hedge_costs) / filled

``required_rebate_per_contract`` is then the distance from the fee actually
charged. Positive means the exchange must give back that much per contract; if
it exceeds the current fee, a discount is not enough and a true rebate (a
negative fee) is required. Note ``hedge_costs`` retains the aggressive fee on
legged-out contracts, which no passive rebate offsets. This matches Scenario D
in ``rebate_pivotality_analyzer.py`` and is computed here only so the summary
file is directly readable; #10 remains the authority on incentive analysis.

Output (written to ``results/pivotality/``)
-------------------------------------------
``pnl_samples.csv``    one row per (session, p, max_position, seed) with every
                       ``generate_pnl()`` field. This is the file #10 reads and
                       groups into the ``List[pd.Series]`` its API expects.
``daily_summary.csv``  one row per (session, p, max_position): mean and std
                       across seeds, plus the break-even fee and rebate.
``run_manifest.json``  parameters, resolved symbols, contract spec, fee tier
                       and data windows — so a sample file is reproducible.

Run:
    uv run src/run_pivotality_inputs.py
